Fault tolerant design - VHDL 

This project shows the implementation of two hardware techniques for fault tolerance 
1) N modular redundancy for MAC modules
2) N modular redunndacy with spares for voting logic

Fir filter is fully parametrized in file _variable_io_package_ with fir order, input and output data width and of course
the modularity degrees.

Enter a vivado suite and in its terminal find a folder in which you saved the script. 
Once you are in there run a command : source run.tcl

Following documentation and explanation is in the documentation (availlable on Serbian)
